# Ruby widgets demo

A short notebook to demo IRuby input widgets.  Launch with binder:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nbgallery/dashboards/master?filepath=ruby%2Firuby_widgets.ipynb)

If you want a stand-alone docker image, the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in this directory builds on top of jupyter/base-notebook and is mostly similar to how it works in binder.

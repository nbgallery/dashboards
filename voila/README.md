# Voila experiments

This directory contains some example notebooks relevant to our [use case](../README.md).  The included Dockerfile builds on top of [jupyter/base-notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/base-notebook) and includes the voila server extension along with a few common packages.
